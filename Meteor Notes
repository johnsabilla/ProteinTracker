Meteor
	- a platform for building a single page application.
	- a SPA a web application that works in a single page load.
	- Uses Javascript in all layers. Devs only need to know/use javascript. Simplifies development.
	- Supported in Mac and Linux.
	- Uses DDP to talk between client and server
		- Disctributed data protocol
			- Publish and sucribe
			- remove procedure calls

Characteristics
	- Only uses Javascript. same JS APIs on client and server
	- Automatic updating of pages
	- Eliminates need for REST APIs
	- Latency handling
	- Self-contained application bundles

Technologies in Meteor
	- Javascript
	- Node.js - (meteor uses node.js differently. node.js uses event driven non-blocking I/O model. usually a node application handles an operation in a single thread and handles it asynchronously. In Meteor different instances of node.js is being used so multiple threads are being used. A single thread per request. Meteor uses it's own packaging system.)
	- MongoDB - Meteor uses both mongodb in client and server. Meteor has a special abstraction over mongoDB that let clients write to db then that data is replicated to server.
	- Handelbars - templating library. used to we can separate HTML and javascript so we don't have to mix them together.

meteor create <project name>	: create a meteor application
meteor  						: run server

Meteor App Structure

/client 		- runs on client only
/server 		- runs on server only
/private 		- assets for server code only
/public 		- static assets, fonts, images, etc
/lib 			- runs before anything else
/test 			- doesn't run anywhere
(anything else) - runs on client and server
main.* 			- runs after evertying else

meteor list 		: lists all the packages in your project
meteor add <package name> : adds a package to your project
meteor remove <package name> : removes a package out of your project

Templating

Collections

Publishing


client side caching
scaling

best practices:
project structure - not as regimented MVC profile structure
templates refreshing - semantics of create, rendered and destroyed 
helpers can be very helpful
keeping things up to date
using custom oauth 2.0
